- "Transactions rely on trust"
	- but then digital payment providers came to be
- 7 basic design principles to a digital payment
	- Network integrity
		- stop double spend
		- show history of coin
	- Distributed Power
		- Everyone has the history
		- There is no centralised control
	- Value is Incentive
		- Peers who wish to support network get rewarded
	- Security
		- Built around public key infrastructure so must be secure
	- Privacy
		- Transactions are private
		- You only see the public key of a transaction, not info
		- Keys will change
	- Rights preserved
		- You should only be able to use what is yours
	- inclusion
		- All can use
		- slim client for access so narrow bandwidth usage

# Everledger
- Started in April 2015
- MD has history in payment and supplychain process
- Diamond industry has been asking for problem solving in the payment and supplychain area for years
- Diamond industry has financial centers in London and NY, and mines in Sub-Saharah, India etc
- Industry struggles from fakes, is paper driven, and historically poor with records
- There is a demand in the industry to protect the diamond certificate
- Each Diamond has has 40 metadata points that make it uniquely identifiable
	- Can be lasered into stone
	- And string of these points can become the unique ID in the blockchain
- Mining offices and import/export offices hold databases of the diamonds, and Everledger work with the UK/US/Aus Diamond authorities (for mined diamonds) and 1 major supplier in the US for polished diamonds
- *"How do Everledger do concensus?"*
	- Node strictly controlled by governing office
	- use consortium of of countries/financial institutions 
	- Private Network federated model
- Now that model has been pressured tested (pun intended?) in controlled and limited but high demand market, now looking to expand into luxury items with histories (e.g traded art), and build insurance models from the back of this
