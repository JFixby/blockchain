# BLOCKCHAIN
A repository for notes from [Blockchain Nottingham](https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-Nottingham/) andd for any blockchain experiments.

- This is github so it's going to run out of memory pretty fast...but it can still hold smart contracts, applications, and links to Bluemix experiments etc.

I am now officially [certified by IBM](https://github.com/alxstuart/blockchain/blob/master/AlexStuartBlockChainCertifcate.pdf) for completing 'Blockchain For Developers' on [DeveloperWorks](https://developer.ibm.com/courses/all-courses/blockchain-for-developers/).

## Meetup Notes
1. [An Introduction to Blockchain](https://github.com/alxstuart/blockchain/blob/master/Introduction_to_blockchain.md) Jan 2017
  *  "Our co-organiser Tom Geraghty will be giving you all an overview of the Blockchain, its origins, applications and ultimately its future impact on the World. We then will be joined by Leanne Kemp - CEO of Everledger - via Skype - [@everledgerio](https://twitter.com/@everledgerio). Leanne will be sharing with us details of her own Blockchain journey. Everledger tracks and protects Diamonds and other valuable assets in the Blockchain, creating a permanent digital ledger for asset certification and transaction history. "

2. [Blockchain: Energy](https://github.com/alxstuart/blockchain/blob/master/BlockchainMeeting2.md) Feb 2017
  * "Blockchain Ubiquity - Will innovation and application in the Energy Industry get us there faster?" 
  * Hosted by [@Neil Penners](https://twitter.com/TheNeilPenners)
  
3. [Blockchain: A Developers Guide](https://github.com/alxstuart/blockchain/blob/master/BlockChainMarch2017.md) March 2017
  * Hosted by Jack Kleeman
  * "I have been developing with Blockchain for approaching a year now, first with Everledger - creating applications on the Hyperledger platform, and now at Duo where I am constantly working with bitcoin. I will give a run down of what got me excited about the field, what I perceive to be the useful applications of Blockchain, in money and elsewhere, and what sort of tools are available to begin development without too much of a learning curve." 

4. [Introducing Zonafide](https://github.com/alxstuart/blockchain/blob/master/%23%20Blockchain%20June.md) June 2017
* Hosted by [@Paul Worrall](https://twitter.com/zoneoftrust)
* "Zonafide’s mission is to enable people to work together to prevent fraud. It is the first non-cryptocurrency application of the blockchain intended for the general public on Android and iOS. It enables people to declare Activities that require other’s to have Acknowledged as legitimate before a counterparty acts on them. It can be applied to many scenarios, with mutual or authoritative trust requirements, having a goal to be completely ubiquitous in its use."
