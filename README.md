# BLOCKCHAIN
A repository for notes from [Blockchain Nottingham](https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-Nottingham/) andd for any blockchain experiments.

- This is github so it's going to run out of memory pretty fast...but it can still hold smart contracts, applications, and links to Bluemix experiments etc.

## Meetup Notes
1. [An Introduction to Blockchain](https://github.com/alxstuart/blockchain/blob/master/Introduction_to_blockchain.md) Jan 2017
  *  "Our co-organiser Tom Geraghty will be giving you all an overview of the Blockchain, its origins, applications and ultimately its future impact on the World. We then will be joined by Leanne Kemp - CEO of Everledger - via Skype - @everledgerio. Leanne will be sharing with us details of her own Blockchain journey.

  * Hosted by Jack Kleeman
  * "I have been developing with Blockchain for approaching a year now, first with Everledger - creating applications on the Hyperledger platform, and now at Duo where I am constantly working with bitcoin. I will give a run down of what got me excited about the field, what I perceive to be the useful applications of Blockchain, in money and elsewhere, and what sort of tools are available to begin development without too much of a learning curve."
