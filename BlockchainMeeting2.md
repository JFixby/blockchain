# Blockchain Meeting 2

- 1/5th of the worlds population are &#39;invisible&#39;; no paper records, leads to modern-slavery, vulnerability
- UN said in 2015 that by 2030, &quot;nobody will be left behind&quot;
- ID2020: summit in the UN, figure out a legal identity, open source supported end identity exchange layer for technology, globally useful digital identity system
- The Status Quo doesn&#39;t understand that globalisation has already finished (stage 1), Brexits won&#39;t stop that!

- This leads to the blockchain
- People are rejecting large organisations….people want it mobile…people want it to be responsive and app and social

- Our original institutions no longer fit this template…thats where the unicorns come from and thats where we need to move to the distributed ledger

- 3 disruptive pillars: distributed ledger, secure digital identity, trusted execution environment
	-Distrubted Ledger already well known in Blockchain environment
	- SDI
		- self sovereign (is it I or alias of me?)
		- open mustard seed(n-source framework for developing and deploying secure and trusted cloud-based and mobile applications)
		- u-port, levels, of assurance, LOA4 (highly secure situation, 3 factor authentication), increase points to decrease risks of identity fraud, how do you get the trust across

- TEE: secure area of the main processor in a smart phone, sensitive date is isolated

## Energy Use Cases for Blockchain:

-
  - P2P Energy EV
  - Mobility
  - Smart/IOT
  - Assets/Supply Chain

- P2P: Transactive Grid, LO3 Energy, Electron is a UK based business, start with retail switching, extending to Grid and P2P
  - The first step is to remove middle men from the process, but &#39;paper&#39; flow soon becomes part of that
- EV/Mobility: Proof Of Concept with Slock.it, does your e-car become an e-wallet and the charging station a node? Why cant I pay to charge my car at one place from my &#39;home&#39; electricity plan
- IOT: Connected...but isolated, Apple homekit is only useful if everything else you have is applehome kit too
  - why not just give ID interaction, make micro-payments critical to the system

- Assets&amp;SupplyChain: Can we follow an asset through its lifecycle using the blockchain, logical place for the public blockchain
