# Blockchain June 2017
## Introducing Zonafide 

Hosted by (and run by) Salina and Paul

## Intro
> "There's an opportunity in inperfection"
* Zonafide is 'working together to prevent fraud' and 'securing activities'
* Collaborate to stop activities happening that they didn't plan to do
* Is there a way of building more trust between companies and individuals
* Three pillars of solving the problem of identify theft, cyber crime, regulation, friction in the customer experience
	* People
	* Activities
		* The battle to secure your information is lost
		* Focus on what people can do with the information instead
	* Collaboration
		* With ever organisation with technology, they are set in their ways with transport in
		* but 
* Zonafide assures acitivies are genuine
* Zonafide enables you to send someone an assurance that an activity is genuine
* Familes, friends, professionals assure you activies
* Less likely to become a target for fraud
* Zonafide is a digital wallet for securing activities (find it on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.interition.zonafide&hl=en_GB) and iOS)
 
## The Model
* First usecase was deilvering blockchain training to register services (getting married, birth certificates, death certificates etc)
* Register services acknowledge life events for a fee
* Focus now on service providers accepting life event notice
* Created training model for using the Etherium stack and integrating into a customer management system
* Zonafide works on a 'zero knowledge proof'
	* You'd get something that is not the information, but something you can trust proves that the information is true
	* No private data goes in, the authorative body (expected by the verifier) and a mutual party acknowledge, and the result is checked by the verifier
		* Authorative acknowledger oracle to confirm the verfiers are accounted for
		* E.g in a wedding name change scenario, the activator is the bride, the registrar is the authorative body, the utilities company is the verifier

## Example activities
* Working Together
	* Treasurer in a club has accountability because he has two members acknowledge
* Reassuring Customers
	* Bank can create an acitivity that can be compared to the message; prove the message is actually from supplier, for that activity
* Preventing Scams
* Looking out for each other
* Helping with limits
	* You can't move over Â£1000 from account without having partner acknowledge etc 

## Roadmap
* build platform for accepting authorative acknowledger oracles
* Find a way to reward acknowledgers
	* Bounty on acknowledgers
* Tamper proof contact addresses
	* alert if there are any changes made at either end for contact address being changed
* Hardware Wallet
	* How secure do you make a cryto session
* Activity pseudo-anonymity


## Technical details & Questions
* The app is built on cordova, due to single dev and multiple plaforms
* Although running on etherium, zonafide could easily transfter across to other platforms for it's "Together Token" technology e.g. Hyperledger
* The model
