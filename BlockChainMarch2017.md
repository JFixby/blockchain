#BlockChain March 2017
##Blockchain a Developers Guide
- Jack works for a startup in Cambridge
- First got involved because hes an economic student with a hobby of programming
- But he realised how archaic finance and financial training is
- Blockchain should be able to open up markets 
- Diamond databases do or have been hacked, everledger improved this by storing the information in the blockchain
- Blockchain requires you to know whether it offers any benefits over the status quo
- The fault in the blockchain industry right now is the hype, people just want it to keep looking interesting in the market
- Blockchain is needed when theres a shared record amongst users who dont trust each other
- The verifiability of the data still comes down to the end user
- Good data needs to come in...blockchain doesnt improve the quality of the information, just the integrity
- When you do build a blockchain application, it needs to be distributed and/or secure
- Hyperledger doesnt need to have ‘mining’ like bitcoin because the system will dispute malicious nodes, so you dont need to worry so much about one node dominating the network
- There is a question about whether the industry should challenge an existing democratically managed or legally binded process of trust when applying blockchain
- Blockchain is ultimately just a database with some cool features that allow synchronous use and less worries about trust

##Etherium vs Hyperledger 
- Eherium is free but EVERYTHING is public
- Hyperledger accomodates the industries that will need private 

##Building your Blockchain
- All data is stored...think about how little information you can store that is critical to 

E.g. When there is an image, hold a cryptographic hash of the image, 64bit, so that the image can be confirmed to be the same without needing to take up all the space an image would

- Chain code is running on each with Hyperledger, written in GO, deployed via Docker 
- Channels exist in hyperledger, these allow processes off the main blockchain that limit the work that needs to be done until there is a dispute

- Hyperledger have been letting everledger be a figurehead of its technology

- Openbazzar is an basically a bit-torrent version of a shop
- Duo will use blockchain to help build trust between purchases in a P2P marketplace
